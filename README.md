# node-red-node-helloWorld

This is getting started tutorial on how to create a simple function node on [node-red](https://github.com/node-red/node-red) platform.

Goal of this function node is to check the validity of [Forge OSS Bucketkey](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/buckets-POST/), if the bucket key is compliant with 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MadhukarMoogala/node-red-node-helloWorld.git
cd node-red-node-helloWorld
start notepad++ node-helloWorld.code-workspace
Edit `.code-workspace` to add `path` to node-red project.
code .
```


Enjoy!!
